# Quick Code Review

Run 5 essential review commands in parallel, then merge findings.

## Execution

Spawn these review commands as parallel Task agents. Each agent must:
1. Read the command file at the given path
2. Follow its WORKFLOW exactly
3. Return the complete review report

### Parallel Commands
1. `commands/review/correctness.md` — Logic flaws, broken invariants, edge-case failures
2. `commands/review/style-consistency.md` — Codebase style, language idioms
3. `commands/review/dx.md` — Developer experience, onboarding
4. `commands/review/ux-copy.md` — User-facing text clarity, error recovery
5. `commands/review/overengineering.md` — Unnecessary complexity, YAGNI violations

## Task Agent Prompt Template

For each command, spawn a Task agent with this prompt:
"Read and execute the review command at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/commands/review/{name}.md`. Follow its WORKFLOW exactly. Review the current working tree changes (`git diff`). Return the complete review report as specified in the command's OUTPUT FORMAT."

## After All Complete: Merge

Combine all 5 agent reports into a single focused review:
- Deduplicate findings that appear in multiple reports
- Sort by severity (BLOCKER > HIGH > MED > LOW > NIT)
- Merge file summaries across all reports
- Produce unified assessment: Ship / Don't Ship
