description: Observability augmentation for an existing workflow. Scans the files in scope for the given workflow, identifies dark paths (code with no logging, metrics, or tracing), and writes a structured instrumentation plan (04b-instrument.md) into the existing workflow directory. Does NOT write application code. Registers itself in the workflow's 00-index.md augmentations list so wf-implement and wf-verify can read the plan as additional context.

# External Output Boundary (MANDATORY)
Apply the boundary rule in [_output-boundary.md](../_output-boundary.md) to every external-facing output
this operation produces: translate workflow context to product language and leak-check before publishing.

You are running `wf-instrument`, an **observability augmentation** that adds an instrumentation plan to an existing workflow.

> **Loaded as a sub-procedure (not a standalone key).** Augmentation is now *shape-decided* (`augmentations-needed` in `02-shape.md`) and applied by the lifecycle: `plan` loads this file to author its artifact, `implement` wires it, `verify` re-checks it. There is no `/wf instrument` command anymore. Run only the mode the calling stage requests.

> **Deep reference — wide-event observability.** For the canonical wide-event / structured-logging patterns (tail sampling, canonical log lines, context-rich queryable events) this augmentation designs against, load [wide-event-observability.md](wide-event-observability.md) — the former standalone `wide-event-observability` skill, folded in here as this augmentation's knowledge base.

> **Foundation vs. per-change (the boundary).** This augmentation designs signals for **one change**, against the
> project's existing observability foundation. To establish or audit that **project-wide** foundation — the schema,
> emit layer, sampling, pipeline, backend, and dashboards — use `/wf observability` (`init` → `build` → `audit`).
> **When `.ai/observability.md` exists, design against it:** use its Block-A schema as the canonical field
> vocabulary (do not invent divergent keys) and its Block-E pipeline as the delivery path. Read it in Step 0.

# Shape
This is an **augmentation**, not an entry point. It writes into an existing workflow directory — it never starts a new workflow.

```
existing-workflow/
  00-index.md          ← updated (augmentations registry)
  02-shape.md          ← read (scope)
  04-plan-*.md         ← read (what will change)
  04b-instrument.md    ← written by this command
```

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Requires | An existing workflow at `.ai/workflows/<slug>/` with at least `02-shape.md` present. |
| Produces | `04b-instrument.md` — observability plan for the workflow scope |
| Updates | `00-index.md` — adds entry to `augmentations:` list |
| Does NOT | Write application code, modify the plan, or advance the workflow stage. |
| When to run | After `/wf shape` and before or during `/wf implement`. Running during implement is fine — wf-implement reads this file as additional context. |
| Next | `/wf implement <slug>` (if not already running), or continue the existing implement stage. |

> **Optional second opinion.** After the inventory and signal-design sub-agents
> return (before writing `04b-instrument.md`), you may offer `/consult <critique
> this signal design — coverage blind spots, cardinality, PII exposure>` (or
> `/consult <provider> …`) — a read-only multi-model panel that checks a judgment
> call with real tradeoffs. Model may self-run when clearly valuable (pin `codex`/`claude`); otherwise just offer it.

# CRITICAL — scope discipline
You are an **observability architect**, not an implementer.
- Do NOT write application code. Do NOT modify `02-shape.md`, `04-plan-*.md`, or any stage artifact.
- Your output is the instrumentation *plan*, not the implementation. `wf-implement` builds the code; this command tells it what to build.
- Be specific enough to implement (name exact files, functions, and signal fields) but do not write the implementation itself.
- Follow the steps below exactly in order.

# Step 0 — Orient (MANDATORY)
1. **Resolve slug** from `$ARGUMENTS`. This MUST match an existing workflow directory.
   - If `.ai/workflows/<slug>/` does not exist → STOP: "No workflow `<slug>` found. Start one with `/wf intake <description>`."
   - If `02-shape.md` does not exist → STOP: "Workflow `<slug>` has no shape yet. Run `/wf shape <slug>` first."
2. **Check for existing augmentation:**
   - If `04b-instrument.md` already exists → WARN: "An instrumentation plan already exists for `<slug>`. Running again will overwrite it. Proceed? (yes to continue)"
   - If confirmed to proceed, note this is a re-instrumentation run.
3. **Read the workflow context:**
   - Read `02-shape.md` in full — this defines what is in scope.
   - Read any `04-plan-*.md` files present — these name specific files and steps.
   - Read `00-index.md` frontmatter — check `current-stage`, `status`, and any existing `augmentations:` entries.
   - **If `.ai/observability.md` exists at the repo root**, read its **Block A** (canonical wide-event schema) and
     **Block E** (collection pipeline). The signals you design MUST use that schema's field vocabulary and target
     that pipeline — not a fresh convention. This is how per-change instrumentation stays consistent with the
     project foundation. If it does not exist, design against the shared doctrine and note that
     `/wf observability init` would establish the project-wide contract.
4. **Identify files in scope:**
   - Extract the explicit file list from `02-shape.md` ("Scope in" or "Files in scope" section) and any plan files.
   - This is the set of files the instrumentation must cover.

# Step 1 — Observability gap analysis
Launch both sub-agents in parallel. Do not proceed to write the plan until both complete.

### Explore sub-agent 1 — Current instrumentation inventory

Prompt with ALL of the following:
- For each file in scope (from Step 0), read the file and identify all existing observability signals:
  - **Logging**: any log statement (`console.log`, `logger.info`, `log.Printf`, `logging.info`, structured log calls, etc.)
  - **Metrics**: any metric emission (`counter.inc`, `histogram.observe`, `statsd.increment`, `prometheus.Counter`, etc.)
  - **Tracing**: any span or trace call (`span.setAttributes`, `tracer.startSpan`, `opentelemetry`, distributed trace context propagation)
  - **Error tracking**: any error capture (`Sentry.captureException`, `bugsnag.notify`, error logger calls)
- For each file, classify its instrumentation quality:
  - `good`: structured logging with business context, metrics, or tracing present
  - `partial`: some logging but missing business context, metrics, or tracing
  - `poor`: no structured logging, only bare `console.error` or `fmt.Println`
  - `dark`: no observability whatsoever
- Identify **dark paths**: functions or code paths that will be changed by this workflow but have no observable signal — you won't be able to tell if they're working after the change.

Return as structured text:
- `instrumentation_inventory`: list of `{file, quality: good|partial|poor|dark, existing_signals: [description]}`
- `dark_paths`: list of `{file:function, reason: "no signals on this code path"}`
- `instrumentation_framework`: detected logging/metrics/tracing libraries (e.g., "pino + prometheus", "zerolog + otel", "python logging + datadog")

### Explore sub-agent 2 — Instrumentation design

Prompt with ALL of the following context:
- The workflow's `02-shape.md` (what is being changed and why)
- The list of `dark_paths` from sub-agent 1
- The detected `instrumentation_framework` from sub-agent 1

For each dark path and for each partially-instrumented path that will be touched:
- Design the minimum set of signals that would let someone:
  1. **Verify** the change worked correctly in production (observable success state)
  2. **Debug** a regression introduced by this change (observable failure state + context)
  3. **Measure** the performance or business impact of this change (observable magnitude)
- Signal design rules:
  - Use the existing instrumentation framework (do not introduce a new logging library)
  - **If `.ai/observability.md` exists, use its Block-A canonical field names** — do not invent divergent keys
    (`user.id`, not `userId`/`user_id`). Schema consistency is what makes the project's dashboards queryable.
  - Follow wide-event patterns: emit structured fields, not string-formatted messages
  - Include business context where relevant (user ID type, request ID, relevant entity IDs)
  - Flag any fields that must be redacted or hashed (PII, secrets, tokens)
  - Keep signals at the right level: function-level for internal hotspots, request-level for endpoints, event-level for async operations

Return as structured text:
- `instrumentation_plan`: list of `{file, function_or_path, signal_type: log|metric|trace|error, signal_name, fields: [{name, type, example, pii: true|false}], rationale}`
- `pii_warnings`: list of any fields that require redaction
- `new_signals_count`: number of new signals designed

# Step 2 — Write `04b-instrument.md`

Merge findings from both sub-agents into the instrumentation plan artifact.

**`04b-instrument.md` frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
schema: sdlc/v1
type: augmentation
augmentation-type: instrument
slug: <slug>
parent-workflow: <slug>
instrumentation-framework: <detected framework>
dark-paths-found: <N>
signals-designed: <N>
pii-warnings: <true|false>
status: ready
created-at: <run `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` to get the real timestamp>
---
```

**Body sections (in order):**

## The Instrumentation
<!-- STORY SECTION — first, and self-sufficient. A reader who reads only this section understands what was produced, the load-bearing decisions and counts, and the top risk; the structured sections below are drill-down, not a substitute. Voice per `../_narrative-voice.md` — no "This {NOUN} implements…" openings. 1–4 short paragraphs. -->

## 1. Current state

A table of instrumentation quality across the files in scope:

| File | Quality | Existing signals | Dark paths |
|------|---------|-----------------|------------|
| `path/to/file.ts` | good/partial/poor/dark | log: yes, metrics: no, traces: no | — or list |

Summary: `<N>` dark paths found across `<M>` files. Framework: `<detected>`.

## 2. Instrumentation plan

A table of what to add:

| File | Function/path | Signal type | Signal name | Key fields | Rationale |
|------|--------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| `path/to/file.ts` | `functionName()` | log | `payment_processed` | `user_id`, `amount_cents`, `provider`, `duration_ms` | Verify payment outcome in production |

## 3. Signal designs

For each signal in the plan, the exact shape of the event/log/metric. Use the detected framework's idioms.

**Example (pino/Node):**
```typescript
// In path/to/file.ts — functionName()
logger.info({
  event: 'payment_processed',
  user_id: redact(user.id),   // hashed — PII
  amount_cents: payment.amount,
  provider: payment.provider,
  duration_ms: endTime - startTime,
  outcome: 'success' | 'failure',
  error_code: error?.code,    // null on success
}, 'payment processing complete');
```

**Example (Go/zerolog):**
```go
// In path/to/handler.go — ProcessPayment()
log.Info().
    Str("event", "payment_processed").
    Str("user_id", hashUserID(userID)).
    Int64("amount_cents", payment.Amount).
    Str("provider", payment.Provider).
    Int64("duration_ms", elapsed.Milliseconds()).
    Str("outcome", outcome).
    Msg("payment processing complete")
```

Adapt to the actual detected framework. Show the exact field names and types.

## 4. PII & security notes

List any fields in the plan that require special handling:

| Field | Risk | Recommended handling |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| `user.email` | PII | Hash with SHA-256 before logging |
| `payment.card_number` | PCI sensitive | Never log — use last-4 only |
| `auth_token` | Secret | Redact entirely |

If no PII concerns: write "No PII concerns identified in the planned signals."

## 5. Implementation notes

Specific guidance for `wf-implement`:
- Which files to touch and in what order (to avoid re-touching a file multiple times)
- Whether any new imports are needed (and whether they're already in `package.json` / `go.mod`)
- Whether any new environment variables are needed (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL`, `METRICS_ENDPOINT`)
- Any conflicts with the existing plan steps in `04-plan-*.md` that might affect ordering

This section is **direction, not a plan** — do not enumerate full implementation steps. `wf-implement` owns the implementation.

# Step 3 — Update `00-index.md` augmentations registry

Read `00-index.md`, then add or update the `augmentations:` field in its YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
augmentations:
  - type: instrument
    artifact: 04b-instrument.md
    status: complete
    created-at: <timestamp>
```

If `augmentations:` already exists (from a prior augmentation on this workflow), append to the list. Do not overwrite existing entries.

Also update `updated-at` to the current timestamp.

# Step 4 — Hand off to user

Return per [_chat-return.md](../_chat-return.md) — narrative lead (what was found, built, or measured, and what it means for the user), then the structured anchors below.

Emit a compact chat summary:

```
wf-instrument complete: <slug>
Files in scope: <N>
Dark paths found: <N>
Signals designed: <N> (<log/metric/trace/error breakdown>)
PII warnings: <none | N fields require redaction — see §4>
Framework: <detected>
Next: /wf implement <slug> — instrumentation plan will be read as additional context
Consider: /wf experiment <slug> to design a controlled rollout for this change
Artifact: .ai/workflows/<slug>/04b-instrument.md
```

If dark paths are zero, note:

> No dark paths found — the files in scope already have adequate observability coverage. The plan documents existing signals for reference.

# What this command is NOT

- **Not an implementer** — `wf-instrument` designs the instrumentation plan. `wf-implement` builds it. Do not write application code.
- **Not the project-wide foundation** — it does not set up the schema, emit layer, sampling, pipeline, backend, or dashboards. That is `/wf observability` (`init`/`build`/`audit`). This augmentation plans **per-change** signals *against* that foundation; when `.ai/observability.md` exists it designs to that contract's schema and pipeline.
- **Not a logging style guide** — it designs signals for this specific workflow change, not a general logging policy for the entire codebase.
- **Not a prerequisite** — instrumentation is optional. `wf-implement` works without it. But if you're shipping something to production and you can't tell whether it worked, you should run this.

## Step — Sibling YAML `instrument` (v9.22.0+, Phase 3)

After writing the instrument MD (`.ai/workflows/<slug>/04b-instrument.md`
or, when invoked as an augmentation under a slug,
`.ai/workflows/<slug>/augmentations/<inst-id>.md`), write a sibling
`.yaml` next to it with `artifact: instrument`. The view-layer renderer
projects this as a signal table (kind-coloured chips per row) plus a
dark-paths callout list and an optional PII-warning counter.

**Required whenever you write the `instrument` sibling YAML:** also write the
sibling `.html.fragment` next to it. First load
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/wf/reference/_fragment-authoring.md` and follow
its wrapper, snippet, and verifier rules. The fragment must stay deterministic
from the sibling YAML (same YAML → byte-identical HTML) and pass
`scripts/verify-fragment.mjs` (Check 7) clean.

Shape:

```yaml
# 04b-instrument.yaml — or augmentations/<inst-id>.yaml
artifact:   instrument
framework:  "opentelemetry"
signals:
  - name: "checkout.attempt"
    kind: counter            # counter | gauge | histogram | log | trace | event
    path: "services/cart/handlers/checkout.ts:start"
    note: "Increment on every POST /checkout, before validation."
  - name: "checkout.duration_ms"
    kind: histogram
    path: "services/cart/handlers/checkout.ts:end"
  - name: "checkout.failure"
    kind: log
    pii:  true              # mark when payload contains user identifiers
    path: "services/cart/handlers/checkout.ts:catch"
    note: "Redact stripe_customer_id before emit."
  - name: "checkout.span"
    kind: trace
    path: "services/cart/handlers/checkout.ts:full"
dark_paths:
  - path:   "services/cart/promo/apply.ts:rejection"
    reason: "No signal on rejected promo codes — silent failure mode."
  - path:   "services/cart/webhooks/stripe.ts:retry"
    reason: "Retry loop has no histogram; cannot tell tail latency from happy path."
pii_warnings: 1
```

Authoring rules:
- `signals[]` must have at least one entry. `kind:` is required —
  the renderer colours each row by kind, so misclassifying a histogram
  as a counter gets the wrong visual treatment.
- Mark `pii: true` on any signal whose payload includes user-level
  identifiers (email, account id, IP). The renderer surfaces these
  with a redaction warning chip.
- `dark_paths[]` is optional but is usually the most useful section to
  a reviewer — it names places where the *absence* of signal is the
  finding. Skip when the audit found no dark paths (the chat summary
  already handles that case).
- `pii_warnings:` is the count of `pii: true` entries in `signals[]`.
  Keep them in sync — the renderer reads this directly for the badge.

## Step — Write free narrative fragments

Author **free narrative fragments** for any beat the structured page can't tell — as many as the story needs. Follow [_fragment-authoring.md](../_fragment-authoring.md) **Step F2** for the rules (unrestricted raw HTML, no contract or sibling `.yaml`, `NN-` label ordering).
