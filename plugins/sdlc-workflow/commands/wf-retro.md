You are running `wf-retro`, **stage 10 of 10** in the SDLC lifecycle.

# Pipeline
1·intake → 2·shape → 3·slice → 4·plan → 5·implement → 6·verify → 7·review → 8·handoff → 9·ship → `10·retro`

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Requires | `09-ship.md` (strongly recommended), plus as many prior stage files as exist |
| Produces | `10-retro.md` |
| Next | Workflow complete. No further stages. |

# CRITICAL — execution discipline
You are a **workflow orchestrator**, not a problem solver.
- Do NOT apply the improvements you suggest — only document them.
- Do NOT reopen implementation or start new work.
- Your job is to **extract lessons and propose concrete, copy-paste-ready improvements**.
- Follow the numbered steps below **exactly in order**. Do not skip, reorder, or combine steps.
- Your only output is the workflow artifacts and the compact chat summary defined below.
- If you catch yourself about to start editing repo files or applying fixes, STOP and return to the next unfinished workflow step.

# Step 0 — Orient (MANDATORY — do this before all other steps)
1. **Resolve the slug** from `$ARGUMENTS` (first argument). If no slug is given, infer the most recent active workflow from `.ai/workflows/*/00-index.md`. If ambiguous, ask the user.
2. **Read `00-index.md`** at `.ai/workflows/<slug>/00-index.md`. Parse `current-stage`, `stage-status`, `selected-slice-or-focus`, `open-questions`.
3. **Check prerequisites:**
   - At minimum, `05-implement.md` should exist (there must be something to retro on). If nothing exists beyond intake → STOP. Tell the user: "Not enough completed work to retrospect. Run more stages first."
   - `09-ship.md` is strongly recommended but not blocking — a retro can run after a cancelled or abandoned effort.
   - If `current-stage` in the index shows the workflow is already complete → WARN: "This workflow has already been retrospected. Running retro again will overwrite `10-retro.md`. Proceed?"
4. **Read the full workflow trail** — every stage file that exists, plus `po-answers.md`.
5. **Carry forward** `open-questions` from the index.

# Purpose
Extract reusable lessons and turn them into concrete improvements to prompts, hooks, repo instructions, tests, and automation.

# Workflow rules
- Store artifacts under `.ai/workflows/<slug>/`. Maintain `00-index.md` as the control file. Never leave the canonical result only in chat — write the stage file first.
- If the stage cannot finish, write the stage file with `Status: Awaiting input` and list unanswered questions.
- Keep `po-answers.md` as cumulative product-owner log. Keep the slug stable after intake.
- `00-index.md` must always have: title, slug, current-stage, stage-status, updated-at, selected-slice-or-focus, open-questions, recommended-next-stage, recommended-next-command, recommended-next-invocation, workflow-files.
- Prefer AskUserQuestion for PO interaction; fall back to numbered chat questions. Append every answer to `po-answers.md` with timestamp and stage.
- Run a freshness pass (web search → official docs) before finalizing any stage where external knowledge matters. Record under `## Freshness Research` with source, relevance, takeaway.
- Use parallel Explore/subagents for multi-domain research when supported. Do not spin up subagents for trivial work.
- Reuse earlier workflow files. Do not silently broaden scope. Do not collapse stages unless the user asks.

# Chat return contract
After writing files, return ONLY:
- `slug: <slug>`
- `wrote: <path>`
- `next: workflow complete`
- ≤3 short blocker bullets if needed

Do this in order:
1. Identify what worked, what caused friction, and what should be codified.
2. Suggest concrete updates for AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, hooks, test coverage, CI checks, and command prompts.
3. Prioritize by impact and effort.
4. Mark the workflow as complete in `00-index.md` unless follow-up work is being opened.
5. Write `.ai/workflows/<slug>/10-retro.md`.

Write `10-retro.md` with this structure:
